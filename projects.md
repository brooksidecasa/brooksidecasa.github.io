# projects

## fence

most of the fence is in good shape, but there are some holes here and there, so corey and autumn will work to mend it rather than replace it entirely. with three dogs, it's imperative the fence is secure for even the smallest of our dogs: an 11 lb. chihuahua mix.

## floors

prior to move-in, the floors need to be redone. they are just short of falling apart.

## foundation

the foundation has been compromised, so we have somebody coming out to redo the supports and build a retaining wall near some of the exposed footings.

## garage

the garage has a semi-finished room above it, but it is painted close to black, and the stairwell's insulation is incomplete. there is some flooding near the doorway, which will require a french drain (or similar solution). it also lacks gutters.

## garden

there is currently a short raised bed in the back yard, but its feasibility as a productive garden is unknown.

## lawn

traditional lawns are bad for the environment and invite invasive species. the plan is to work with the local community garden to think up some ideas for a more native, more wildlife-friendly yard solution.

## water line

the pipe that comes in from the street is currently galvanized steel, so it will need to be replaced with pex (cross-linked polyethylene) for long-term safety and durability.
