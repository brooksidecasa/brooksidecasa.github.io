# projects

## fence

with three dogs, it's imperative the fence is secure for even the smallest of our dogs: an 11 lb. chihuahua mix. we may need to replace more than initially thought!

## floors

prior to move-in, the floors need to be redone. they are just short of falling apart.

## garage

the garage has a semi-finished room above it, but it is painted close to black, and the stairwell's insulation is incomplete. there is some flooding near the doorway, which will require a french drain (or similar solution). it also lacks gutters.

## garden

there is currently a short raised bed in the back yard, but its feasibility as a productive garden is unknown.

## lawn

traditional lawns are bad for the environment and invite invasive species. the plan is to work with the local community garden to think up some ideas for a more native, more wildlife-friendly yard solution.

## self-hosted

- jellyfin
- firefly-iii
- maybe a to-do list?

## water line

the pipe that comes in from the street is currently galvanized steel, so it will need to be replaced with pex (cross-linked polyethylene) for long-term safety and durability.
