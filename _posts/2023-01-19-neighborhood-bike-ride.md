# neighborhood bike ride

went on a lil' ride around the neighborhood last evening after dark. even though we're kind of at the bottom of a hill at the new place, it's a gentle hill and i didn't feel like i was huffing and puffing too much getting up it. [the bike shop](http://www.oakcitycycling.com) and few other little shops and restaurants are a quick little trip away, and i can see myself stopping by there regularly. it looks like they (the bike shop) have weekly bar hours on thursdays which would be a really good way to see those folks!
