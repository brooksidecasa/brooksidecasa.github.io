the structural engineer came out and looked at the foundation today. the good news is that it is fixable, and it won't be out of our budget to do so; there is no bad news! the plan is to 1) move the water heater, 2) redo the supports, 3) add more dirt and a retaining wall to one or two sides.

we're waiting on a few more estimates from the handyman, then another from the engineer, and we should be able to get back in touch with the seller and move forward with the closing on the 25th. fingers crossed things continue to go well. ðŸ¤ž
