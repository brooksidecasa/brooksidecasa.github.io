it's been a busy few weeks! we've spent every weekend at casa brookside, slowly and steadily making progress on the yard cleanup. the back section of the fence is now down, and we've fixed a few other sections of it like the gate scraping the ground and some gaps near the driveway. we've cut down lots of little privets, which are so invasive they have their own [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privet_as_an_invasive_plant). we also removed a ton of trash, like old ladders, a failed garden bed, and some gnarly metal lawn border.

the trailer (a 2017 winnebago micro minnie) now sits in the driveway, so i no longer have to pay a monthly storage fee.

the foundation is fixed! the deck is done! the only remaining post-sale items we have left are the floors (which start next week) and a broken window (which our handyman is trying to source from the manufacturer). once the floors are done, we'll be able to start living there full time.

our bedroom and living room furniture order from ikea should be here tomorrow, so we're heading over to build that after work.
