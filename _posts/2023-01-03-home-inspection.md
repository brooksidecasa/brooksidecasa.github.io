title: "home inspection"
---

the loan application has gone off to the underwriters, and the appriasal came back about as expected.

some things we found during the inspection:

- termite damage on the back deck supports
- damage on the back deck floor planks
- fence is even worse than we initially realized
- crawl space is a bit funky with supports, but probably fine
- sewer cleanout cap is broken, but seems functional

all-in-all, nothing that's making us think that we should walk away. we do plan to ask for some allowance for some of the major things.
