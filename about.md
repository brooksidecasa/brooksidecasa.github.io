# about

the land is flat, oblong (short side to street), and backs up to a small creek. the house has four bedrooms: two downstairs and two upstairs. there are two full bathrooms: one downstairs and one upstairs. the second level has vaulted ceilings. there is a large, covered porch on both the front and back of the house. the back yard is fenced in with wooden privacy fence.

prior to european invasion, the land was kept by the ancestors of the [lumbee tribe](https://www.lumbeetribe.com), [tuscarora nation](https://tuscaroranationnc.com), and [catawba nation](https://www.catawba.com).

## nearby attractions

one of the main factors that drew autumn and corey to brookside was the proximity to some of our favorite things. there is a bodega across the street which offers a selection of food and brews along with a small variety of groceriesâ€”think convenience store. in the same tiny mixed-use building is a tattoo parlor, coffee shop, and "curiosities store." right next to, and behind, the mixed-use building is a park complete with two baseball fields and a large dog park.

## website

this website is meant to house (pun intended) little bits of info about the house. brookside is the name of the street the house lives on, and when researching domain names, brookside.casa was the favorite chosen by autumn and corey. it is also referred to as "brookside bungalow," "the brookside house," and "downtown crash pad."

it is hosted on github pages, and the full source code is [available here](https://github.com/brooksidecasa/brooksidecasa.github.io).
