in late 2022, corey sent autumn a zillow listing to a very cute little house downtown. after sleeping on it, the pair decided to take a look at it. the asking price was a bit high, and it needed some work, but it had been on the market for a decent amount of time, and they decided to make a lowball offer.

after a round of negotiations, they settled on a fair price with the owner, and soon found themselves in the midst of a home-buying experience.
